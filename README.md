Project 7 - React Gallery App - By: Kendra Roberson

GOAL: I am shooting for Exceeds Expectations with this project.

ABOUT: In this project, I will use JavaScript and JSX to build out picture gallery components, use React Router to set up routes and a search page, use Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API to display images in my app, along with using logic to handle certain functionalities.

NOTE: To Fetch Data: You will need to request an API key of your own to run this. My API Key is hidden from pubic view in my config.js file along with my node_modules by hiding the config.js file in the .gitignore file.  You will need to use npm start command to run the app on the local host 3000.

SPECIAL FEATURES: There aren't many. I added a blue background image that I thought pictures would pop on, I added the ability to view the picture in a new browser window when the photo is clicked. There's a 404 error message produced with an icon. My loading indicator is working - which is just text at this point. A 'No Results' message is produced in the console if no images are found with the search criteria used. My search field and buttons work along with my Navigation buttons - of which I have 7 instead of 3.

FINAL THOUGHTS: It is really cool to have only ONE page rendering the job of many pages! Routing/Wiring the thing up to produce images was the biggest obstacle for me, along with a little struggle with 'this', props, and state. Other than that, it seemed pretty straightforward.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
